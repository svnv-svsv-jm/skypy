This is still a beta build of this randomizer. It is mostly a proof of concept.

What it does:
when you click the randomizer.py file it will give you two new bin files in the output.

What you need to do next is make a directory for those bin files.
For the encount_data_array.bin, it is world/ik_data/field/pokemon/encount_data/Encount/data
For the pokemon_data_array.bin it is world/ik_data/field/pokemon/pokemon_data/pokemon_data

Then just make the world folder a zip and load it into trinity when the romfs for ZA is loaded in

Click apply mods then add it to your mod location.

Let me know if you run into any issues or have any ideas for features while I am working on the actual randomizer
